# HR Analysis Job Prediction


# Goal
To analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

# Objectives
- Do Exploratory Data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)
- Plot bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention
- Now build a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1
- Measure the accuracy of the model
